Focusing on 5 NBA seasons:

- 2014 - 2015
- 2015 - 2016
- 2016 - 2017
- 2017 - 2018
- 2018 - 2019

The training data was created by subtracting the away team averages from the home team averages in the following categories (left to right): FG, FGA, FG%, 3P, 3PA, 3P%, 2P, 2PA, 2P%, FT, FTA, FT%, ORB, DRB, TRB, AST, STL, BLK, TOV, PF, PTS, W

This was done for every game in those respective seasons.

The testing data was made by observing playoff match ups for each of these seasons.

The notation of top_team refers to the home team in the training data, and in the testing data it refers to the team with the lower seed in the playoffs of that season.

* NOTE * Training Data and Testing Data are the same files from the Decision Tree Model that were used for testing in the WEKA Software.

The results come from using this same data from the previous model but by using a Bayesian Classifier from the WEKA Software.
